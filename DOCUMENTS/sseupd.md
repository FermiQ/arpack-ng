## Overview
The `sseupd` subroutine is the single-precision, real arithmetic counterpart to `dseupd`. It is called after `ssaupd` (the single-precision symmetric Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration routine) has successfully converged. `sseupd`'s purpose is to return the converged approximations to eigenvalues (Ritz values) of the symmetric eigenvalue problem A*z = lambda*B*z. Optionally, it can also compute:
1. The corresponding approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors).
2. An orthonormal (Lanczos) basis for the associated approximate invariant subspace.
3. Both.

These quantities are derived from the Lanczos factorization computed by `ssaupd` for the linear operator OP, which is defined by the `MODE` selection in `ssaupd`. The approximate eigenvalues of the original problem are returned in ascending algebraic order.

## Key Components
- **`sseupd` (subroutine):** The main routine for extracting Ritz values and Ritz vectors (or Lanczos basis) from the results of a converged `ssaupd` run. It transforms these quantities back to the original problem's eigensystem if a spectral transformation (like shift-and-invert) was used in `ssaupd`.

## Important Variables/Constants
- **`RVEC` (LOGICAL, INPUT):** Specifies whether Ritz vectors are computed.
    - `.FALSE.`: Compute Ritz values only.
    - `.TRUE.`: Compute Ritz vectors.
- **`HOWMNY` (Character*1, INPUT):** Specifies how many Ritz vectors are wanted.
    - `'A'`: Compute all NEV Ritz vectors.
    - `'S'`: Compute a selection of Ritz vectors (specified by `SELECT` array). (Note: `'S'` might not be fully implemented in some older versions).
- **`SELECT` (Logical array, INPUT/WORKSPACE):** If `HOWMNY = 'S'`, specifies which Ritz vectors to compute. Used as workspace if `HOWMNY = 'A'`.
- **`D` (Real array, OUTPUT):** Contains the Ritz value approximations to the eigenvalues of A*z = lambda*B*z, in ascending order.
- **`Z` (Real array, OUTPUT):** If `RVEC = .TRUE.` and `HOWMNY = 'A'`, this N by NEV array contains the B-orthonormal Ritz vectors.
- **`LDZ` (Integer, INPUT):** Leading dimension of `Z`.
- **`SIGMA` (Real, INPUT):** The shift value used if `IPARAM(7)` (MODE in `ssaupd`) was 3, 4, or 5.
- **`BMAT`, `N`, `WHICH`, `NEV`, `TOL`, `RESID`, `NCV`, `V`, `LDV`, `IPARAM`, `IPNTR`, `WORKD`, `WORKL`, `LWORKL`, `INFO`:** These arguments *must* be the same as those passed to the final successful call of `ssaupd`. They should not be modified.

    - **`WORKL` (Real array, OUTPUT/WORKSPACE):** Contains info from `ssaupd` and is further used by `sseupd`. `IPNTR(8:10)` point to locations for Ritz values of the original system, error bounds, and the eigenvector matrix of the tridiagonal matrix T.
    - **`INFO` (Integer, OUTPUT):** Error flag. Specific negative values indicate errors similar to `ssaupd`, with additional ones like:
        - `-14`: `ssaupd` did not find any eigenvalues.
        - `-15`: `HOWMNY` invalid.
        - `-17`: Discrepancy in converged Ritz value count between `ssaupd` and `sseupd`.

## Usage Examples
`sseupd` is called *after* `ssaupd` has converged (i.e., `INFO = 0` from `ssaupd`).

```fortran
C ... (previous ssaupd reverse communication loop) ...

      IF (INFO .EQ. 0) THEN
C   ssaupd converged, now call sseupd
          RVEC = .TRUE.     ! To compute Ritz vectors
          HOWMNY = 'A'      ! Compute all NEV vectors

          CALL SSEUPD ( RVEC, HOWMNY, SELECT, D, Z, LDZ, SIGMA,
     & BMAT, N, WHICH, NEV, TOL, RESID, NCV, V, LDV,
     & IPARAM, IPNTR, WORKD, WORKL, LWORKL, INFO_EUPD )

          IF (INFO_EUPD .EQ. 0) THEN
C            Successfully retrieved D (eigenvalues) and Z (eigenvectors)
C            Process the results...
          ELSE
C            Error in sseupd
          END IF
      ELSE
C        Error in ssaupd or other condition (e.g. max_iter reached)
      END IF
```
For detailed examples, consult the `EXAMPLES/SYM` directory in the ARPACK source, specifically files like `ssdrv1.f` (standard symmetric) or `ssdrv2.f` (generalized symmetric). The `ex-sym.doc` file also provides context. `sseupd` is the single-precision version of `dseupd`.

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Interactions:**
    - `sseupd` is critically dependent on the successful completion of `ssaupd`.
    - It uses many of the same arguments passed to `ssaupd`, which must not be altered.
    - The `WORKL` array, populated by `ssaupd` and further utilized by `sseupd`, is essential for storing intermediate results like the tridiagonal matrix H, its eigenvectors, and Ritz estimates.
    - `IPNTR` provides pointers to various data structures within `WORKL`.
    - If spectral transformations (shift-invert, etc.) were used in `ssaupd` (indicated by `IPARAM(7)`), `sseupd` transforms the Ritz values (and vectors if computed) back to the original problem's eigenpairs using the `SIGMA` parameter.
    - The results `D` (eigenvalues) and `Z` (eigenvectors) are for the original problem A*z = lambda*B*z.
